django-worldwide
================

A custom location app for Django, that takes care of cities, states, countries, for you.

Patches welcome: http://github.com/un33k/django-worldwide

Usage
=====

If you want a worry free location app, then this is for you.
Just load it up, populate the database and all your apps can use it.

Here what you need to do:
        
1. Stick ``"worldwide"`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, Then import it like: from worldwide import *
            
That's it.


Example
=====
 # create a city
 City(name="New York City", population = 99999).save()

 # create a country        
 Country(name="Canada", iso_2="CA", iso_3="CAN")
 Country(name="United States", iso_2="US", iso_3="USA")

 # create two cities with same names and verify unique slugs
 c = City.objects.filter(name="Ottawa")
 self.assertEquals(len(c), 2)
 self.assertEquals(c[0].slug, "ottawa-ontario-canada")
 self.assertEquals(c[1].slug, "ottawa-illinois-united-states")


ToDo
=====
add templatetags
add testcase for templatetags
add fixture to test on objects
add full fixture to populated all cities in the world (in xml format, json requires lot of RAM)
